# StarWars Tracker

TLDR: A wep app to track the star wars movies/shows you have watched, and how much time it would take to watch the ones you haven't seen yet. 

## About

As a big star wars fan, I've always wanted to be a super nerd about the universe and consume every possible pice of media made about it. One major criteria of that activity is to watch all the movies and shows that Disney keep pumping out. My friends and I are also big completionists, and it seems like we are always subconsciously calculating how much watch time we have left for every show. That's how the idea came about.

I decided I could make a nice little website that could allow us to track all the Star Wars shows and their watch time, so that we could easily see how much we had left. It also seemed like a great oppurtunity to explore Firebase and its integrated authtentication system. 

Please feel free to go have a look yourself, and track your own completion of the universe far far away :)
